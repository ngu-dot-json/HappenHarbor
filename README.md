# HappenHarbor
HappenHarbor is an in-development modern social event platform focused on centralizing local events on an accessible and easy-to-use web platform using a hosted MySQL Database Management System and Django frameworks.

We have collectively found finding new things to do in Calgary to be a frustrating and rather inconvenient ordeal. Organizers tend to advertise through miscellaneous and disconnected means and platforms, making it difficult to find and keep track of events throughout the year. Planning with friends is made even harder given that everyone has different schedules and availability. With our final project, we aimed to create one platform for both advertising and planning. We wanted to allow promoters to make their events known to groups of people like us looking for something to do. We also wanted users to be able to form groups to attend these events with, with these groups being composed of friends and/or strangers, as we've always found that going out alone to be nerve-racking and that common interests can be an excellent way to network and meet new people. Our solution to the problems associated with event planning is shared between attendees and hosts. We aimed to add the elements of social media we found useful in event planning to a digital bulletin board where organizers could post events to be attended by our user base.

Just by taking a walk around campus, it is easy to find clubs, sports teams, and many other individuals and groups trying desperately to promote their respective events to the general public. However, these flyers are placed sporadically, making it hard to keep track of everything going on. This issue is exacerbated by social media as a means to advertise, as it makes it even more difficult to find events as an attendee due to the vast amounts of content to sift through on the internet. As a promoter, it can also be incredibly difficult to find an audience to sell tickets to since, as previously established, it can be hard to find event advertisements and flyers in a sparse but densely populated physical and digital landscape. We aim to address the problem of there being a lack of a modern, central platform for advertisers and consumers to use to promote and find events. Project Description: Happen Harbor is a digital event hub used to display anything from sports, concerts to festivals. Want a place to find something cool for you and your friends to do?
